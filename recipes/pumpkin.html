        <li>Mix all-purpose flour, butter, coconut oil, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl until well distributed. Stir in water and whiskey to form a clumpy dough. Divide dough in half; place in separate containers. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>

        <li>Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust starts to brown, about 20 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil and reduce heat to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C); continue baking until set, about 40 minutes.</li>
